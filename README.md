# synbiotix

Synbiotix donut project is implemented using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern in combination with the coordinator design pattern.  

Alamofire is used to retrieve data.

Views are created using SwiftUI.

When you run the app a screen with donut frostings and fillings to choose is displayed. Only one frosting and filling can be chosen. Fillings are optional. When finish order button is pressed the app is redirected in a different screen that shows the summary of the order. The user can start over by pressing the order again button.

The app can be tested using the built-in framework XCTests
